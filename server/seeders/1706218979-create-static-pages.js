Cancellation Policy</strong>: 95 Star flexible cancellation policy allows you to cancel your reservation without a fee up to a certain time before your scheduled pickup, depending on the location. Cancellations after these times are subjected to a fee. In general, cancellation 24 hours prior to pick-up time almost never incurs any cancellation fee. Cancellation within 6-24 hours incurs only a 25% cancellation fee; but you may call and request a waiver, which we will consider empathetically. Cancellation within 1-6 hours usually incurs a 50% cancellation fee. Cancellation within the last hour (especially when the driver has left for the pick-up); but before the customer is on board, will incur a 75% cancellation fee. Once the passenger is on board, but then abandons the trip, a full fare is charged.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>2. Wait Times</strong>:&nbsp;Grace time is 10 minutes after the scheduled pickup time for a non-airport pickup location. For airport pick-up location, the grace period is 15 minutes after the scheduled time or 30 minutes after the flight&nbsp;landing; whichever is earlier and what the customer has requested. After the grace time, either driver and passenger can agree to continue waiting and incur a waiting charge (generally $1 per minute starting from the actual scheduled time), or the driver&nbsp;will exercise the right to declare&nbsp;"No Show" and full fare will be charged, in this case. Our drivers and dispatcher make these decisions based on several factors, including the level and manner of communication from the customer and whether or not the driver will miss his/her next assigned pick-up.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>3. Wrong Booking</strong>:&nbsp;In case of service has to be cancelled due to the wrong Vehicle being&nbsp;booked, the client will be charged the full fare. Example: If the driver arrives and finds out # of passengers or Luggage/Bags exceeds the vehicle capacity, mentioned on the booking page.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>4. Booking On Short Notice</strong>: There\'s no guarantee for Reservation if it\'s reserved within less than 24&nbsp;hours of a pickup time. Please call us at&nbsp;1833-495-7827 for less than 24 hours of Reservation.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>5. Unforeseen Circumstances</strong>: 95 Star keeps the right to cancel any reservation at any time due to unforeseen reasons.</p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>6. Rates</strong>: Whatever rates are in effect at the time of booking, are the going rate for that reservation. Rates for any future bookings can change at any time; depending on weather, demand, traffic, special events in the area etc</p>',
